You are helping me implement Phase 2 of the Ensembl MVP.

Phase Name: Venue Confidence & Booking Readiness

Context:
- Ensembl MVP is feature-complete
- All backend APIs already exist and MUST NOT be changed
- No new models, routes, or database fields are allowed
- The goal is to improve venue-side usability and booking confidence
- This phase is UI/UX-first, functionality-second

STRICT SCOPE RULES:
- DO NOT add payments
- DO NOT add ratings or reviews
- DO NOT add notifications
- DO NOT add real-time features
- DO NOT redesign the overall UI theme
- DO NOT touch authentication or database models

You may ONLY:
- Recompose existing data in new views
- Improve clarity, layout, and information hierarchy
- Add frontend-only helper logic if needed

---

## REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Venue Dashboard (Frontend Only)
Create a Venue Dashboard view using existing gig and application APIs.

The dashboard should display:
- Active Gigs (open and upcoming)
- Each gig card should show:
  - Gig title
  - Date & time
  - Number of ensemble applications
- Pending Applications section
- Accepted Ensembles section
- Verified Gig Count (already available on Venue model)

UX Requirements:
- Clear section headers
- Empty state messages (e.g. “No active gigs yet”)
- Fast scannability

---

### 2. Improve Gig Applications View (Venue Side)
Enhance the gig applications list so venues can make decisions quickly.

Each Ensemble application card should show:
- Ensemble name
- Member count
- Instruments represented
- Verified gig count
- Combined bio snippet
- Media embed preview (if available)

Actions:
- Accept
- Reject

DO NOT change application logic — only presentation.

---

### 3. Ensemble Credibility Signals (Surface Existing Data)
Wherever an Ensemble is shown to a Venue:
- Highlight verified_gig_count prominently
- Show member list with instruments
- Display “Past verified gigs” count clearly

No new metrics. Use existing fields only.

---

### 4. Application Comparison UX
When a gig has multiple applications:
- Present them as stacked cards
- Ensure consistent layout for easy comparison
- Make Accept / Reject buttons visually distinct

Goal:
Enable venues to compare applications without clicking into each one.

---

### 5. Copy & Micro-UX Improvements
Improve text labels and helper copy ONLY where it helps clarity.

Examples:
- “Apply” → “Apply as Ensemble”
- “Accept” → “Accept & Start Chat”
- Empty states that guide action

No branding or tone overhaul.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (IMPORTANT)
1. Venue Dashboard layout
2. Gig Applications card redesign
3. Ensemble credibility surfacing
4. Empty states & microcopy polish

---

## OUTPUT EXPECTED
- New or updated frontend components only
- Clear comments explaining intent
- Zero backend changes
- TODO comments only for post-MVP ideas

Remember:
This phase exists to increase VENUE TRUST and SPEED TO BOOKING.
