You are helping me implement Phase 3 of the Ensembl MVP.

Phase Name: Awareness, Feedback & Emotional UX

Context:
- Ensembl MVP is functionally complete
- Phase 2 (Venue Confidence & Booking Readiness) is complete
- Backend and database MUST NOT be changed
- This phase is frontend-only
- Goal: Improve user awareness, feedback, and emotional engagement

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT add real notification systems
- DO NOT add backend events or polling
- DO NOT add WebSockets
- DO NOT add emails
- DO NOT change existing APIs
- DO NOT break minimalist design

---

## REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Activity Feed (Soft Notifications)
Implement a "Recent Activity" panel for:
- Musician Dashboard
- Venue Dashboard

Activity items should be derived from existing data:
- New unread messages
- Ensemble invites received
- Invite accepted / declined
- Gig application accepted / rejected
- Gig confirmed by both parties

UI Requirements:
- Simple vertical list
- Timestamp (relative time)
- Icon per activity type
- Empty state message

---

### 2. Visual State Indicators
Add subtle indicators:
- Dot or badge on Navbar items when attention is needed
- Examples:
  - Chat tab: unread messages
  - Ensembles tab: pending invites
  - Gigs tab: status changes

Indicators must:
- Be non-intrusive
- Use existing state/data
- Clear automatically when viewed

---

### 3. Contextual Feedback Banners
Replace generic alerts with inline banners:
- Success (green)
- Info (blue/purple)
- Warning (amber)

Examples:
- “Your ensemble was accepted for this gig 🎉”
- “You’ve been invited to join an ensemble”

Banners should:
- Be dismissible
- Auto-hide on navigation

---

### 4. UI Micro-interactions
Add subtle motion:
- Card hover lift
- Button press feedback
- Fade-in transitions
- Skeleton loaders for async content

Use Tailwind-compatible animations only.

---

### 5. Creative Microcopy
Improve empty states and helper text to feel:
- Musical
- Friendly
- Encouraging

Avoid jokes or sarcasm.
Maintain professional tone.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
1. Activity Feed
2. Navbar indicators
3. Feedback banners
4. Micro-interactions
5. Microcopy polish

---

## OUTPUT EXPECTED
- Frontend-only changes
- New reusable components if needed
- Clear comments explaining UX intent
- TODOs only for post-MVP ideas

Remember:
This phase exists to make Ensembl feel alive, confident, and self-guiding.
