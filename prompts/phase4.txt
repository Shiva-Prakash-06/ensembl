You are helping me implement an INTERNAL Admin system for the Ensembl MVP.

Phase Name: Internal Admin & Platform Oversight

Context:
- Ensembl MVP is feature-complete (Phases 1–3)
- Admin is NOT a public-facing feature
- This is an internal tool for business and developers
- Must follow ethical and privacy-safe practices

STRICT RULES:
- Admin must NOT view private chat messages
- Admin must NOT see sensitive personal data
- Admin must NOT impersonate users
- Admin must NOT hard-delete data
- All admin actions must be reversible (soft disable)

---

## ADMIN AUTHENTICATION

Implement:
- Admin role = "admin" in User model
- No admin signup from UI
- Admin account created via seed script or environment variable
- Separate /admin/login route

---

## ADMIN PERMISSIONS

Admin can:
- View users, venues, ensembles, gigs
- See aggregate analytics
- Soft-disable users, venues, gigs, ensembles
- View verified gig counts
- View activity metrics

Admin cannot:
- Read chat messages
- Edit content
- Accept/reject gigs
- Modify payments (none exist)

---

## REQUIRED BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION

1. Add admin_required decorator
2. Create admin blueprints:
   - /api/admin/users
   - /api/admin/venues
   - /api/admin/ensembles
   - /api/admin/gigs
   - /api/admin/analytics

Endpoints should:
- Return summarized, non-sensitive data
- Mask emails (e.g. sh***@gmail.com)
- Support soft-disable actions via is_active flag

---

## REQUIRED FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION

Create Admin Dashboard with pages:
- AdminDashboard.jsx
- AdminUsers.jsx
- AdminVenues.jsx
- AdminEnsembles.jsx
- AdminGigs.jsx
- AdminAnalytics.jsx

Dashboard must show:
- User counts (musician vs venue)
- Active vs inactive users
- Total jam posts
- Active ensembles
- Open gigs
- Completed gigs

UI Requirements:
- Table-based layouts
- Clear labels
- Confirmation modal for disable actions
- Neutral, internal-tool design

---

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Reuse existing API services where possible
- Admin routes should be protected via role check
- Add comments explaining ethical boundaries
- Add TODOs only for post-MVP admin extensions

Remember:
This admin system exists to OBSERVE, CONTROL SAFELY, and ANALYSE —
not to spy or interfere with user trust.
